    How are the models designed?</a>
        <div id="How" class="collapse">
          <p>
   The models are designed in Blender.   They use a variety of different mechanisms to lift the balls, 
   but all are designed for 8mm, or 5/16th inch metal bearing balls.  Because the tracks are designed 
   to be the minimum size possible, so as to best highlight the balls as they travel the mazes, it's 
   important that the balls be clean and perfectly spherical, and also heavy.  It's also important 
   that the models be almost perfectly level. 
      </p>
      <p>
   In some cases an individual model is designed and prototyped in stages, first testing the lifting 
   mechanism, then the means of descent.  If everything checks out, the sections are combined, and mounting
   locations for motor, solar panel, battery and switches are added.  Five or six prototypes are
   built and run for an extended time to ensure they operate with reasonable reliability.  Usually it's
   necessary to make adjustments to the tracks, especially those on descent, to reduce the frequency
   at which balls drop off the model.  Once this is done, the final design is ready to produce.

 How are the models made?</a>
 <div id="Made" class="collapse">
  <p>
   Each model is 3D printed using PLA plastic on consumer FDM printers.  This takes anywhere from six to 
   fifteen hours, depending on each model's size and complexity.  A model is made from two to seven 
   PLA parts, which are inspected and cleaned of any residual plastic that's a byproduct of the printing
   process.  (None of the models require support material, which simplifies the cleaning process).  Once 
   the PLA parts are prepared they, along with the electric parts are assembled into complete models.  
   There's no painting -- the plastic is the color it appears.

 I want to know more. Can you give me more technical details?</a>
 <div id="More" class="collapse">
  <p>
   Sure.
   </p>  
   <p>
   The lifting mechanisms are all over the map.  In fact, that's the artists' greatest interest.  
   Generally they carefully leverage gravity, as it's the most forgiving means of managing the 
   balls' locations.  For example, the lifting gears rely on gravity for the balls to fall into 
   the gears lifting chambers, and then again rely on gravity to direct the balls out to different
   paths through the chambers shaped holes.  If, for example, a track simply met a shaped hole 
   directly without a larger "boarding" chamber, there is a likelyhood that the ball would jam.
   Having boarding chambers allows for the balls to jostle around and sort out which one will 
   enter the chamber next.  
</p>
<p>
   The paths back down are also designed in a number of ways, but the most intricate of the mazes
   use a standard 1cm on a side tile, where the slope of the path is about four degrees from the 
   horizontal, and the descent between tiles is 0.7mm.  The walls of the tiles are as shallow 
   as possible so as not to hide the balls.  This tile based approach makes it possible to 
   quickly create complex mazes (although solving for a dense arrangement is quite challenging),
   but it still requires adding supporting structures for the 3D printing process.  These 
   support structures are the most time consuming part of each model's design.  The simplest 
   description of the challenge is that you can't have any angles between perfectly horizontal 
   about about 25 degrees from horizontal -- FDM printers simply can't do this without 
   removable support material.  It would be possible to use support material, but that would 
   increase the print and clean-up efforts, and would actually detract from the look of the 
   final model.  In fact, the artists' finds that the challenge of designing to avoid support 
   material greatly enhances the final gadget's appearance.  In effect, the supporting 
   structures become part of the model itself.
</p>
<p>
   Before printing a gadget its model must be sliced.  Cura is used for this purpose.
   The tile based approach of designing each model makes it nearly unavoidable to have 
   overlapping solids, and some slicers do not handle these instances well, but Cura has proven 
   quite capable of handling them.  Most parts are printed at 0.2mm layer height and between 
   190 and 200 degrees Celsius.  Some parts require greater tolerances and are printed at a 
   finer layer height.  The maze parts need to be printed at the lower end of the temperature 
   range because they rely on extensive bridging, where the plastic is deposited in mid' air 
   between supporting structures -- it must harden quickly to minimize how much it sags.
</p>
<p>
   The parts come off the printers needing little or no post processing.  At least that's the 
   case when they're well tuned.  It takes some time to get everything adjusted to that level, 
   incuding the ambient temperature in the printing room, and until then it's necessary to 
   perform some cleaning of plastic.  Usually this cleaning is just removing small strings of
   PLA that didn't properly retract when the printer head was moving and not extruding.  This 
   can be a bit challenging on the most complicated models because it's hard to get deep into
   them.
</p>
<p>
   All the models are very challenging to print. 

   The final assembly of the gadgets involves soldering the electric parts together and 
   attaching them to their mounts, attaching all the PLA parts together, usually with screws
   and sometimes glue, then operating them for a while to make sure they are working well.
   It's not uncommon to find balls getting stuck.  That's typically because there's still a 
   stray piece of plastic that needs to be cleared.  Another cleaning may be needed.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, after some testing the models are packaged and made ready for shipping!

 How do I care for my gadget?</a>
 <div id="Care" class="collapse">
<p>
   The most important thing is to not expose it to excess heat.  PLA plastic can deform at temperatures
   above 40 degrees Celsius, or about 104 degrees Fahrenheit.  The gadget may look OK, but 
   deformations of the tracks may prevent the balls from traveling reliably, and there's not much you 
   can do to fix it.  Be especially careful about leaving it in a car that might get hot.
</p>
<p>
   You'll want to keep the balls and tracks clean.  If it is battery powered, be 
   sure to remove the batteries when storing the model.  When replacing the batteries be careful not
   to apply to much pressure as it is possible to break the plastic.  If, however, you do break some 
   of the plastic you'll probably find that the model still works just fine.  (Many of the most 
   fragile plastic parts are there just to support the printing process.  Once the gadget is printed, 
   the only function they serve is to look important).   
</p>
<p>
   The best place for the solar models is in a sunny window, where they can be left indefinitely.  PLA
   has a durable color, so you shouldn't have to worry about the color fading.  When the sun strikes the 
   panel the gadget will run, and even when there isn't direct sun you'll still find that the gadget 
   operates, just very slowly, and in moderate light the gadget will stop.

  <a href="#Type" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse">

  I can't decide if I should get a battery or a solar model.</a>
 <div id="Type" class="collapse">
<p>
   If you're impatient you'll want a battery powered model.  You'll be able to operate it at 
   any time.  So, for example, if you want to show your cool new gadget to a friend, you'll be
   able to do it indoors away from any sunlight.
</p>
<p>
   If you're in an office worker with a window that's got a bit of sun, you should probably get a 
   solar model.  You can leave it in your window and just let it take care of itself.  There's 
   no turning it on or off, and you'll not need to worry about batteries.  If you've got an 
   important phone call or meeting, and it's just too noisy, you can simply turn it away from 
   the sun and it will quite right down.

  Can I get a kit version?</a>

 <div id="Kit" class="collapse">
  <p>
   Not right now.  We're looking into it.  Because the plastic parts are so difficult to print, 
   any future kit is likely to include those along with the electrical parts.  There are some 
   questions we need to answer too.  For example, should we expect kit builders to solder parts 
   together?  Contact us if interested and let us know what you think.

  Can you make the models available so I can make my own?</a>


 <div id="Download" class="collapse">
  <p>
   We plan to make a non-motorized one available on the website.  That one doesn't need any parts,
   and we hope to make it simple enough that most 3D FDM printers will produce a working result.
   If you've got a 3D printer then you've got everything you need!  Stay tuned.
