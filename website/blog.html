   The lifting mechanisms are all over the map.  In fact, that's the artists' greatest interest.  
   Generally they carefully leverage gravity, as it's the most forgiving means of managing the 
   balls' locations.  For example, the lifting gears rely on gravity for the balls to fall into 
   the gears lifting chambers, and then again rely on gravity to direct the balls out to different
   paths through the chambers shaped holes.  If, for example, a track simply met a shaped hole 
   directly without a larger "boarding" chamber, there is a likelyhood that the ball would jam.
   Having boarding chambers allows for the balls to jostle around and sort out which one will 
   enter the chamber next.  
</p>
<p>
   The paths back down are also designed in a number of ways, but the most intricate of the mazes
   use a standard 1cm on a side tile, where the slope of the path is about four degrees from the 
   horizontal, and the descent between tiles is 0.7mm.  The walls of the tiles are as shallow 
   as possible so as not to hide the balls.  This tile based approach makes it possible to 
   quickly create complex mazes (although solving for a dense arrangement is quite challenging),
   but it still requires adding supporting structures for the 3D printing process.  These 
   support structures are the most time consuming part of each model's design.  The simplest 
   description of the challenge is that you can't have any angles between perfectly horizontal 
   about about 25 degrees from horizontal -- FDM printers simply can't do this without 
   removable support material.  It would be possible to use support material, but that would 
   increase the print and clean-up efforts, and would actually detract from the look of the 
   final model.  In fact, the artists' finds that the challenge of designing to avoid support 
   material greatly enhances the final gadget's appearance.  In effect, the supporting 
   structures become part of the model itself.
</p>
<p>
   Before printing a gadget its model must be sliced.  Cura is used for this purpose.
   The tile based approach of designing each model makes it nearly unavoidable to have 
   overlapping solids, and some slicers do not handle these instances well, but Cura has proven 
   quite capable of handling them.  Most parts are printed at 0.2mm layer height and between 
   190 and 200 degrees Celsius.  Some parts require greater tolerances and are printed at a 
   finer layer height.  The maze parts need to be printed at the lower end of the temperature 
   range because they rely on extensive bridging, where the plastic is deposited in mid' air 
   between supporting structures -- it must harden quickly to minimize how much it sags.
</p>
<p>
   The parts come off the printers needing little or no post processing.  At least that's the 
   case when they're well tuned.  It takes some time to get everything adjusted to that level, 
   incuding the ambient temperature in the printing room, and until then it's necessary to 
   perform some cleaning of plastic.  Usually this cleaning is just removing small strings of
   PLA that didn't properly retract when the printer head was moving and not extruding.  This 
   can be a bit challenging on the most complicated models because it's hard to get deep into
   them.
</p>
<p>
   All the models are very challenging to print. 

   The final assembly of the gadgets involves soldering the electric parts together and 
   attaching them to their mounts, attaching all the PLA parts together, usually with screws
   and sometimes glue, then operating them for a while to make sure they are working well.
   It's not uncommon to find balls getting stuck.  That's typically because there's still a 
   stray piece of plastic that needs to be cleared.  Another cleaning may be needed.
